# Linear Regression

### Warnings

Linear Regression...

* ...works best when data is linear.
* ...is sensitive to outliers.

A **predictor**, or *independent variable*, is a variable you are looking at in order to make predictions about other 
variables, while the values you are trying to predict are known as *dependent variables.*

### Multiple Linear Regression

When there's just one predictor, the linear regression model is a line, but as you add more predictor variables, you 
are adding more dimensions to the pictures.

When you have one predictor, the equation of the line is y=mx+b

Adding a predictor variable means that the predicting equation is: y=m1x1 + m2x2 + b

To represent this graphically, we'll need a 3D plot with the linear regression model represented as a plane.
